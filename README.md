GAN is Generative adversarial networks that uses Two neural networks contest with each other in a game(discriminative vs. generative modeling).<br/>
the generative model take random noise or a data within noise and try to predict the data without it.<br/>
the discriminative model take the real data without noise and the prediction of generative model and try to know which is which.<br/>
that being said the model tries to duplicate the real hand written data from the mnist dataset using random noise.
# how to run it:
there is two ways to use it:<br/>
1-colab<br/>
2-localy<br/>
if you're using colab just upload the ipynb file and run it<br/>
localy:<br/>
1-you have to install python 3<br/>
2-the recommended libraries<br/>
3-install ide and open the .py file or .ipynb<br/>
4-run it<br/>
# the recommended libraries:
1-tensorflow<br/>
2-numpy<br/>
3-matplotlib
